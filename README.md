# PracticeApp

## Newbie to Intermediate

This app is made with a purpose to help newbies understand core concepts of Android Development.
There are very limited and not so clear resources available out there, Hence I've decided to fix it.

## Rewrite In Progress!!
I am currently rewritting the whole codebase in a more cleaner way, mvc architecture pattern and with TDD approach. This is work in progress, please checkout the branch "cleanCode1" for the same.

## Android Best Practices

### Clean Code

* Clean Code is one which is easy to read, change, maintain and follows the DRY (Don't repeat Yourself) principle

#### General Rules

* The code structure should be well formatted.
* The code should follow the [DRY Principle](https://medium.com/@Ialimijoro/the-dry-principle-and-why-you-should-use-it-f02435ae9449).
* All the classes and functions should exhibit their individual functionality.
* Introduce modules in your app.

#### Naming and Comment Principles

* All the names in the code should be clear and meaningful.
* Do not add unnecessary and redundant comments in the code.
* The comment should be used to clarify the respective piece of code.

#### Formatting Rules

* The files should be consistent and not very long.
* Files should have headings to explain the purpose of the file.

#### Classes and Functions 

* Generally, all the classes should have separate files.
* Classes and Functions should be too the point.
* Keep the number of arguements in the function to minimum.
